#🚴Real-Time Delivery Route Optimizer

A production-grade delivery routing system that optimizes delivery routes in real-time using Dijkstra algorithm — similar to how Swiggy and Zomato manage their delivery fleet.

##Features
- **Dijkstra Shortest Path** — finds optimal route for every delivery
- **Smart Agent Assignment** — automatically assigns nearest idle agent
- **Dynamic Reassignment** — reassigns orders if a closer agent becomes available
- **Real-Time Tracking** — live agent movement via WebSockets
- **Live Map Dashboard** — React dashboard showing agents moving in real time
- **5 Concurrent Agents** — handle multiple deliveries simultaneously

##Tech Stack
- **Backend** — Python, FastAPI, NetworkX
- **Real-time** — WebSockets
- **Frontend** — React, Vite
- **Algorithm** — Dijkstra shortest path (via NetworkX)
- **Infrastructure** — Docker, AWS EC2

##How to Run

###Backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload

###Frontend
cd dashboard
npm install
npm run dev

Open http://localhost:5173 to see the live dashboard.
